# MatrixLibrary
C++ Matrix Library - multidimensional matrix implementation using template programming

Designed based off reference from "The C++ Programming Language" - A Matrix Design chapter

The goal is to demontrate usages of modern C++ syntax/techniques through implementing the following

1. Matrix interface (basic usages)
2. Matrix representation (vector and slice)
3. Initialising and specifying matrix (operator overloading)
4. Arbitrary dimension (template)
5. Matrix indexing (variadic arguments)
6. Matrix subset selection (constructor and recursion)
7. Matrix format printing (template specialisation and recursion)
8. Algebraic operations (operator overloading, lambda expressions, chaining)
